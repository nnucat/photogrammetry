Note that you will have to scale the resulting disparity maps by integer factors (shown below) before submitting them. Also, we evaluate
 disparities everywhere (except for a border region in the Tsukuba and Venus images), so if your method does not produce disparities in 
some regions (e.g., borders, occlusion), you will have to come up with a way of extrapolating the disparities into those regions. 
After submitting your images, your results will be compared to the other results in a temporary table. Once you have submitted all images, 
you can request that your results be added to the permanent table. Note that we still require that your method is run with constant parameters on
 all 4 image pairs, except for the disparity ranges. 


All disparity images must be in png, pgm, or gif format. Disparities must be scaled by the integer factors shown below. 
 Image pair    Disps.     Scale       
 
Tsukuba 0..15 16  
Venus 0..19 8  
Teddy 0..59 4  
Cones 0..59 4
